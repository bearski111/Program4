Reviewer One:

Overall your code looked clean and ran well on my emulator.
I didn't notice any huge issues, and thought the way you organized 
your code was very logical and easy for anyone to review. One 
recommendation I have would be to use percentages, rather than pixels, 
for your label and picture placement. This will help with making your 
app look better on a variety of mobile devices. I also noticed that you
donâ€™t have a back button on your second page. I recommend adding a button
and event listener in order to make your app easier to navigate. Your 
second page is rather text heavy, but I think for this assignment that is fine.
Nice work!
